// Binary Search

// Sorted list

// divide and conquer approach => O(log(n))

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The steps involved in the binary search algorithm are as follows:

// 1 = Start with the middle element of the collection.
// 2 = Compare the middle element to the desired element.
// 3 = If the middle element is equal to the desired element, the search is complete and the index of the element is returned.
// 4 = If the middle element is greater than the desired element, the search is conducted on the left half of the collection.
// 5 = If the middle element is less than the desired element, the search is conducted on the right half of the collection.
// 6 = Repeat steps 2-5 until the element is found or the search has been conducted on the entire collection.

// sometimes we want to do traversals

// when we want to add or change on every node, thus we have to touch every single node ? => Traversal
