// ---------- GRAPHS ----------------------------------------

// Trees, Linked-Lists and Heaps are all graphs

// Directed Graphs = one way 
// Undirected Graphs = can go in opposite direction as well

// Weighted Graphs - if their edges or connection have values 
// Unweighted Graphs - if their edges doesn't have any values

// Cyclic Graph - when you can complete a cycle(circle) between nodes with edges 
// Acyclic Graph - when there is no circular connection
