// Binary Heap

// used with priority queues 

// Binary Max Heap = Root node is largest, every node below that gets smaller

// Binary Min Heap = Root node is smallest, every node below that gets bigger


// Binary Heaps Lookup or search is O(n) , insert & delete is still O(logN)
// but they are really good for comparative operations


// Priority Queue 

// Every element has a certain priority
// like a nightclub queue, Vip's have a higher priority
// they get to go in first although they came later

// also think about a hospital emergency room as well

// Pro's
//
// PRIORITY
// Flexible size
// Fast insert


// Con's
//
// Slow Lookup
